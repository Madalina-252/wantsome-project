            <h2>Rarau</h2>

            <div id="description">

                <p>Rarau Massif refers to a modest (the highest point is 1651m) but dramatic outcropping of the Eastern
                    Carpathian Mountains that rises to the south of Câmpulung Moldovenesc. Famous for the unmistakable
                    silhouettes known as the ‘Lady’s Stones’, Rarau offers some of the most scenic mountain views in
                    Romania.</p>
                <h3>The Lady’s Rocks (Pietrele Doamnei)</h3>
                <p>The Lady’s Stones and the other rock formations from the highest altitudes are the main attractions
                    of all hiking trails and they have their own legend.</p>


                <p>Among the tales of the place, the most famous legend reminds that the princess Elena, the wife of
                    Petru Rares, the ruler who offered the name "Rarau" to the mountains here. It is said that during
                    the second reign, when the Turks drove through these places, he hid his family and fortune here in a
                    cave. However, with all these, the Turks were able to get here, and princess Elena and her daughter
                    began to pray for salvation, at which time a loud noise was heard nearby. Apparently, at that
                    moment, great cliffs broke up and fell over the place where the princess's fortune was hidden,
                    burying the attackers. Princess Elena and her daughter escaped in this way by the Turks, only with
                    the price of wealth.</p>
