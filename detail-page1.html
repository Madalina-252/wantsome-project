            <h2>Bergen: The fjord capital</h2>

            <div id="description">
                <p>We have many names for the things we love, and few cities in Norway have more nicknames than Bergen.
                </p>

                <p><strong>“The heart of the fjords”</strong> is one of them.</p>

                <p>Even though Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway, it has the vibe of a small town, packed with
                    charm and urban character.</p>
                <h4>“The Hanseatic Wharf”</h4>
                <p>The UNESCO World Heritage site Bryggen, “The Hanseatic Wharf”, is the most obvious
                    remnant from the time Bergen used to be the centre of trade between Norway and the rest of Europe.
                    Today, the wharf houses a museum, shops, galleries, and restaurants, and is a focal point for both
                    locals and visitors.</p>

                <h4>Bergen is also often called “the city between the seven mountains”.</h4>

                <p>By far the most easily accessible summit is Fløyen, 320 metres above sea level. It is connected to
                    the city centre by Fløibanen funicular by a six-minute ride.</p>
