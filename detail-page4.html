            <h2>The Alhambra Gardens</h2>

            <div id="description">

                <p>Alhambra, palace and fortress of the Moorish monarchs of Granada, Spain. The name Alhambra,
                    signifying in Arabic “the red,” is probably derived from the reddish colour of the tapia (rammed
                    earth) of which the outer walls were built.</p>
                <h3>Color, light, aromatic plants and the murmur of water.</h3>
                <p>The Arab gardens are the representation of the longing for paradise. The idea of paradise in the
                    Muslim culture, is seen as a garden full of delights and pleasures where the man can achieve full
                    satisfaction.</p>

                <p>The Alhambra gardens have beautiful water features due to the skilled Arabs working with water The
                    water was brought from the foothills of the mountains to water these beautiful gardens that form
                    nowadays the Alhambra Gardens.
                </p>

                <p>The walls mention the beauty of the garden with decoration of floral motifs and coloured shades. The
                    intensive use of colorful tiles is also a characteristic of the Arab Gardens.</p>
