            <div id="description">
                <h3>A slice of heaven and German history</h3>
                <p>Berchtesgaden is a small, picturesque and historic town located in the southeast of the German state
                    of Bavaria, within a small enclave surrounded on three sides by the Austrian border. The town lies
                    some 30 km south of the Austrian city of Salzburg and some 180 km south-east of Munich.</p>

                <p>You might have heard of it because it’s on the German Alpine Road, one of the most beautiful scenic
                    routes in Germany, or you might have heard about it because some of its residents read like a Who’s
                    Who of Third Reich and World War II history.
                </p>

                <p>Whatever you heard, nothing will prepare you for what you’ll see once you’re here, all under the
                    watch of Mt. Watzmann (one of the tallest in Germany). Also high on a hill is Kehlsteinhaus, better
                    known as Adolf Hitler’s <em>Eagle’s Nest.</em></p>
